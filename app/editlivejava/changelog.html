</ul>

<h2>EditLive! 9.0.2.17</h2>
<h3>Please Note</h3>
<ul>
<li>setBackgroundMode is now a part of the core editor - it is no longer a plugin. Any &lt;plugin name="setBackgroundMode" /&gt; entries in config xml files should be removed.</li>
<li>The &lt;thesaurus "useNotModified" /&gt; config setting has been removed. The thesaurus is checked against the server per standard HTTP caching mechanisms.

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<li>Applying Column properties removed styling from individual cells</li>
<li>Inserting a tab when Track Changes is on was creating a tracked change with the wrong bounds on Windows.</li>
<li>Tables with percentage widths, but absolute cell widths were not being rendered correctly. EditLive now changes the cell widths in these tables to percentage sizes.</li>
<li>When inserting a new row into a table, the new row was not inheriting the tr styles from the previous row</li>
<li>Row deletions are now untracked changes. This works around several track changes bugs.</li>

<h2>EditLive! 9.0.0.75</h2>
<h3>Please Note</h3>
<ul>
<li>EditLive! now requires Java 6. Attempting to use Java 5 will result in an UnsupportedClassVersionError.</li>
<li>Proguard is now used to optimise and reduce the jar size. As a result, all private APIs are now obfuscated. If you have used private API by accident please contact support for assistance.</li>
<li>Applet plugins are now distributed in a single jar file. No configuration changes are required, but files which are now unnecessary will be left behind if you simply overwrite the "editlivejava" folder on your server.</li>
<li>The "Sun" HTTP layer manager is now known as "Oracle".  The "Sun" option remains functional and has been aliased to "Oracle".</li>
<li>The "Oracle" HTTP layer manager is now used by default.</li>
<li>WebDAV is now deprecated, along with the Apache HTTP layer, and both will be removed in a future major release.</li>
<li>&lt;menuBar showAboutMenu="..."/&gt; now defaults to "false". As a result, if the menuBar tag is omitted or the "showAboutMenu" attribute is omitted, the menubar is not displayed.
                                When removing the About dialog you must replicate the copyright notices elsewhere in your software distribution.</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>New media dialog with support for:
            <ul>
                
<li>Insertion of media from social and cloud-based media services.  Any service that supports the <a href="http://www.oembed.com">oEmbed</a> standard will work with this dialog.</li>
                
<li>Inserting media with the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; elements.</li>
            
</ul>
        
</li>
<li>"Megamenu" style dropdowns are now used to display popup menus (eg table wizard, color pickers). New mega menus have been created for:
            <ul>

            <ul>
                
<li>Article, Aside, Figure, Figcaption, Header, Footer, Nav, Section</li>
                
<li>When element borders are turned on (enabled by default), these tags render with dashed borders and the element name in the top right</li>
                
<li>"Create Section" and "Remove Section" have been changed to megamenu style containing all supported tags</li>
                
<li>"Section Properties" now applies to any HTML5 tag</li>
                
<li>Div and Blockquote have been included with these updates</li>
            
</ul>
        
</li>
<li>New In-place Editing UI based on Inline Editing. Using a set of new JavaScript API and configuration options, EditLive!'s UI can be configured for a minimalist aesthetic.
            <ul>
                
<li>&lt;wysiwygEditor tabPlacement="off"/&gt; now functions again in the Applet. Tabs are automatically hidden if only one tab is enabled.</li>
                
<li>The menu bar can be completely removed from EditLive!'s interface by removing the &lt;menuBar&gt; element</li>
                
<li>New &lt;toolbars display="floating"&gt; option switches the main toolbars into a floating toolbar component.</li>
                
<li>New &lt;inlineToolbars showOnMainToolbar="true"&gt; option docks inline toolbars for image and table editing with the main toolbar as contextual toolbars.</li>
                
<li>setResizeableSections(true) JavaScript API enables EditLive! to expand vertically within the page to match the content length rather than display a scroll bar in the editor.</li>
                
<li>The use of megamenus enable developers to optimize the size of the toolbar without trading off on functionality.</li>
            
</ul>
        
</li>
<li>When using Inline Editing, the editor now opens when the user clicks anywhere on the preview pane.</li>
<li>New applet loading screen optimizes loading UI by replacing 2 previous loading screens.</li>
<li>Accessibility reporting and accessibility as-you-type now use WCAG version 2.0.</li>
<li>Improved rendering for the iFrame tag.</li>
<li>raiseEvent applet callbacks are now passed the applet ID (the string used to create the EditLiveJava object) as the first function parameter</li>
<li>Ephox Look &amp; Feel toolbars have been redesigned with a light grey background and flatter buttons</li>
<li>Ephox Look &amp; Feel is now used on all platforms</li>
<li>Class definitions within style sheets that use naming conventions based on camelCase, hyphens or underscores are now automatically converted into user friendly names for EditLive!'s UI.</li>
<li>new &lt;wysiwygEditor stylesVisibility="whitelist"/&gt; setting switches stylesheets into a whitelist mode, where classes are not available via EditLive!'s styles dropdown unless they include the ephox-visible:true CSS property in their definition.</li>
<li>OpenSans is now used for EditLive!'s UI. To enforce anti-aliasing for this font, two system parameters are now passed to the applet JVM:
            <ul>
                
<li>-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on</li>
                
<li>-Dswing.aatext=true</li>
            
</ul>
            If these parameters are not set in the Swing SDK and the platform does not enable anti-aliasing by default, the system font is used instead.
        </li>
<li>New &lt;wysiwygEditor allowLocalImagesWithoutUploader="false" /&gt; setting. With this set to false, when no image upload handler is available the following UI changes are made:
            <ul>
                
<li>Local images display as broken</li>
                
<li>The Insert Image dialog automatically hides the "local image" tab</li>

<h3>Please Note</h3>

            to the "plugins" section of your configuration file to continue using the spell checker. The useNotModified
            attribute of the "spellcheck" tag in the config xml no longer has any effect.
        </li>
<li>EditLive! now uses the Java Preferences API for registry storage on all platforms, unfortunately this means custom words added to the dictionary locally have been reset. This does not affect Linux, which already used Java Preferences.</li>

<li>The &lt;sourceEditor errorDialog="simple" /&gt; configuration option is no longer available.</li>

<h3>New Features</h3>

            <ul>

<li>Tabs are now rendered in JavaScript</li>

<li>Added setMinCrashTimeout API to both <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/EditLive/MinCrashTimeout+Property">Applet</a> and <a href="http://editlive.com/javaapi/editlive/v8.0/com/ephox/editlive/ELJBean.html#setMinCrashTimeout(int)">Swing SDK</a>
</li>
<li>New ELJBean.addCrashListener function for notification of editor crashes. EditLive! Swing SDK no longer provides recovery options to the user.</li>
