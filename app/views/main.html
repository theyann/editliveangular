  <h1>EditLive with AngularJS</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    This sample site is a playground to help to get EditLive to work with AngularJS.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="row">
  The goal: we need EditLive to work with AngularJS the same way TinyMCE does. Checkout the links below, the first page uses tiny mce in a directive, the second uses EditLive in a directive. Both examples should work the same way.
  <br/><br/>
  Note: This project uses the <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-tinymce">ui-TinyMCE</a> project to get TinyMCE to work with Angular. A similar approach could also work for EditLive.
